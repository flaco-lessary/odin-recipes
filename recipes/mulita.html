        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Make the meat filling.</b> Season the steak with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chopped onions and saute for 3-4 minutes before adding the steak and cook until itâ€™s no longer pink. Once done, put the cooked meat in a bowl and cover it with tinfoil to prevent it from drying out.</li> 
            <br>
            <li><b>Prepare the avocado.</b> Next, prepare the avocado by making it into guacamole or mashing it with olive oil, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Cook mulitas.</b> Now, place a pan or skillet over medium-high heat and add some oil to heat the tortilla. Add a layer of cheese and then meat, a little parsley and add more cheese and cover with another tortilla. Brush the tortilla on top with oil. When the cheese melts, flip to cook the other side too. Gently press the tortillas to stick them with cheese and meat. Keep flipping and cooking until all the cheese melts. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Add the fillings and assemble</b>. To serve mulitas, gently lift one side of the tortilla and add the guacamole, diced tomatoes, and optional Jalapenos. </li>
        </ol>
